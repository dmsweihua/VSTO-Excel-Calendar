# VSTO-Excel-Calendar
An excel calendar developed with VSTO supports user-defined date type and type color. You can identify the date type by changing the background color and font color of each date, so as to quickly set and modify the calendar.

You can read the calendar in the database through the interface or save the calendar to the database.

The purpose of developing this software is to make full use of the convenience of Excel operation and quickly manage the work calendar in other management information systems (such as ERP).
